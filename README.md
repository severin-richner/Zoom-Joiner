# Zoom-Joiner

(only works on Windows, use at own risk)

This Script automatically joins Zoom meetings given a Weekday and a time. No Account needed. 
The Script saves the Meetings and assumes these are repeated weekly. Joining is done using the Zoom meeting link and uses the default browser.


Instructions:

1)	Install python (version 3.8+) and the Zoom application.

2)	install python packages via Command Line:	pip install win32gui keyboard

3)	Make sure your standart Browser has pop-ups enabled. (for opening Zoom via link)
	
	(should work fine with: Chrome, Brave, Edge)

Done!

Just open/run the "Zoom-Joiner.py" file with python.


Sidenote: If you don't know the link for the Zoom meeting, the usual format is:

https://zoom.us/j/{Meeting ID}

https://zoom.us/j/{Meeting ID}?pwd={Password}
